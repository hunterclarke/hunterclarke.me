The internet has made us all venture capitalists whether we like it or not. Venture capitalists play a game of asymmetric returns. The vast majority of investments fail. But a few winners more than make up the difference (and add a healthy profit margin).

In the same way venture capitalists place bets knowing most will fail, internet creators play the same game. Most content created on the internet will never be seen. It will never be shared. It will never be noticed.

But a small fraction will explode. The exposure drawn from the 1 out of 1000 going viral is enough to make the other 999 worth the effort.

So how do you play the game to win? Take a lot of chances. Ship all the time. Create prolifically. Create deliberately. Don't take shortcuts, but don't self edit. The content that doesn't make the cut won't be noticed anyways.
